Features
--------

1.  Translates flagged text blocks using the wwlapi server

2.  Configuration data in /js/configuration.js  
    Remove items in the "Defaults" named variable data structionthat are unneeded, e.g DOMAIN: "test".

3.  Translation parameters determined by this order:
     1.  tag to be translated (e.g. sl="en" allow_unscored="y".  if not specified then:
     2.  global tag flagged by id="wwlapi".  if not specified then:
     3.  last stored value in the cookie.

    Note, if using a language picker for source/target language[s], the result will need to be stored in a cookie
    and the page reloaded for the source language to be used in the translations.


4.  Editing.   Editing is turned on by default.  Prevent editing by setting at any level - local
    element, global element or cookie.

5. global translation tag.
   Is identified by id= "wwlapi".  This tag may have any type, e.g. iframe, div...  
   It is recommended that an iframe be used as this is teh best type to be made invisible
   and leave minimal distortion in the page formatting.

6. translated elements.
   The elements to be translated are identified with the attribute wwlapi="tr".
   Any other translation parameter can be set locally to.  If teh source language is modified,
   e.g. sl="new language_X" this will override the global variable and allow the page to translate a 
   block of text that is not the same as the main language of the page.  This might be the case for a 
   quote in latin or other language.

7. Translation color.
   Translation colors are set by the rules for the username and score level.  Currently the username
   may be blank, but if so the IP address is currently substituted.  The colors are set in 

   css/custom.css.

8. If the translation fails, the display shows "no translation".  

9. Strings in the Translation UI.
   The default english Strings for the display are set in js/localstrings.js
   If the string cannot be translated, the original english string is used.  This ensures
   that the display will work at an english language default level.

10.  Tooltip that is visible if the translation is editable.

Bug Fixes
---------

1.  Unescaping characters.  Forced to use a hack to unescape some codes as URL.decode(String) is not 
    working on some of the characters returned.
2.  Modified the lod to allow the user to select a language and trap it via the cookie for use.
3.  Changed the query to remove the minimum_score parameter if minimum_score < 1
