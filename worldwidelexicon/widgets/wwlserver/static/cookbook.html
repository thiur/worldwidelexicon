<p class="p1">&lt;h2&gt;The Translation Cookbook&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;i&gt;by Brian McConnell&lt;/i&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">This tutorial will be part of an upcoming book about building translatable websites and services with WWL and other open translation tools. This quick how-to guide is written for four audiences: ordinary web users, website owners, software developers, and professional translation agencies, with "getting started" sections for each.&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Until recently, building a multilingual website was expensive, difficult and time consuming, and something that only large corporations could really afford to do. The Worldwide Lexicon system makes high quality, best effort translation easy to incorporate into virtually any type of website or computer program. Our goal is to make translation an invisible service that is simply embedded in most of the systems that people think of as the Internet. We're not there yet, but already, it is very easy to add human/machine translation to many types of websites and applications.&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;h3&gt;For Web Users&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The worldwide web may be global in its physical reach, but most web content remains isolated by language. A few interesting web pages are translated into other languages, but the web really behaves more like a hundred smaller networks than one global network. We have been developing tools that make best effort translation accessible to ordinary users, and eventually, part of the web browser itself. Last Fall, we built a preview of what this multilingual web will look it. It is a translation add-on, or plugin, for the Firefox web browser.&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Unlike other translation tools, which simply download machine translations from services like &lt;a href=http://www.google.com/translate&gt;Google Translate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=http://babelfish.yahoo.com&gt;Babelfish&lt;/a&gt;, the WWL translator also enables users to edit and score translations, and makes translating websites a collaborative process. Imagine what the web will be like when every web user is also able to contribute and comment on translations, when hundreds of millions of people are part of a volunteer network to translate the most interesting pages and websites.&lt;p&gt;</p>
