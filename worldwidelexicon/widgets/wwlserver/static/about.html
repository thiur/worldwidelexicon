<h3>About WWL</h3>

The <a href=http://www.worldwidelexicon.org>Worldwide Lexicon</a> is an open source translation system. Our goal is to make browsing the web in any language as easy as browsing the web in your native language.<<br><br>

<h4>For Web Users</h4>

The Worldwide Lexicon is the next step in the evolution of the worldwide web. Our <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/13897>Firefox Translator</a> is an important step in this direction. This addon makes browsing the web in other languages easy and automatic. Simply open a page. If the page is in a foreign language, it translates it.<br><br>

WWL is also an online community where people can meet to read, write and share translations for their favorite websites and blogs. If you see an interesting essay on Le Monde, for example, you can translate it into your language, and then share it with your friends.<br><br>

<h4>For Blogs</h4>

We have built several tools for webmasters. These tools enable you to publish your website or blog in other languages, and to combine several different types of translations (computer translations, translations from volunteers, and professional translations).<br><br>

<h4>For Publishers</h4>

We work with leading publishers to build sophisticated multilingual publishing systems. These solutions enable you to publish your website simultaneously in many languages. You can employ a combination of computer translations (which are fast, but not always accurate), translations that are written by your readers, and professional translators. If you are interested in learning more about how to build a multilingual website, contact <a href=mailto:brian@worldwidelexicon.org>Brian McConnell</a> to learn more.
