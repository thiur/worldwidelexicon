<h2>Services</h2>

Building a multilingual website or web service used to be time consuming, difficult and expensive. In addition to providing a wide variety of free, open source software and tools, Worldwide Lexicon Inc offers turnkey translation solutions for small businesses, enterprise clients and web developers.<p>

<h3>Turnkey Translation Service</h3>

We can help you transform your single-language website into a multilingual website with our turnkey translation services. There is no software to install. We take care of everything for you. Here's how it works:<p>

<ol>
<li>You create special web domains for the translated versions of your website (for example, es.yourcompany.com for Spanish)</li>
<li>We build and host a translation server for you at this domain. This server loads pages from www.yourcompany.com and translates them using the best available human and machine translations.</li>
<li>We use machine translation to obtain an instant, but temporary, translation. This is later replaced with a professional translation (at a cost of 5-10 cents per word) or with a community edited translation (if you allow your users to translate your website).</lI>
<li>We work with several professional translation companies, and can work with your existing provider if you already have one.</li>
<lI>New service can be deployed in minutes, as quickly as you can register new web domains.</li>
</ol>

We charge a straightforward monthly hosting fee for the translation server, starting at $200 per month for a typical corporate website, plus hourly consulting fees for additional system administration, support and custom software development. Per word translation fees vary by language and which professional translation agency you choose to work with.
