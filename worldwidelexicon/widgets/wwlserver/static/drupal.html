<h2>WWL For Drupal</h2>

WWL For Drupal is an interactive translator that adds human/machine translation to Drupal websites. This tool works in a similar manner to the <a href=/wordpress>Word Press Translator</a> and <a href=/proxy>Translation Proxy Server</a>.

The add on provides the following features:<p>

<ul>
<li>Machine translations from popular web translation services including <a href=http://www.google.com/translate>Google Translate</a>, <a href=http://www.apertium.org>Apertium</a> and several others.</li>
<li>Users can edit translations to make them better. You decide who can translate.</li>
<li>Professional translations are available from <a href=http://www.speaklike.com>SpeakLike</a> and other professional translation agencies for a few cents per word.</li>
<li>Easy to install and manage</li>
</ul>
