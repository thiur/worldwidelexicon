WWL is an open marketplace for language service providers. We have built an open API that enables professional translation service bureaus and agencies worldwide to participate in our system. WWL makes your service look like an automated translation service, such as <a href=http://www.google.com/translate>Google Translate</a> or <a href=http://babelfish.yahoo.com>Babelfish</a>, so integrating your professional translation services into a WWL enabled website or application is as easy as using a machine translation service (except with much better quality).  Integrating your business into the WWL network is easy and can be completed in just a few hours.
