<h3>Publishers</h3>

<img src=/image/newspapers.jpg><br><br>

The Worldwide Lexicon collaborative translation platform enables web users to view translated versions of your site in over 40 languages. We have developed a comprehensive suite of open source tools that enable both web users and content producers to read and publish web content across languages.<br><br>

<h4>For Publishers and Content Producers</h4>

With WWL, you can embed translation tools throughout your web properties to make them accessible in dozens of languages. Our system combines professional translation, volunteer or user generated translations, and machine translations to optimize for cost, quality and turnaround time. With it you can publish simultaneously in many languages, while also leveraging your user community or freelance translators to edit and improve upon machine translations.<br><br>

We offer a variety of tools for publishers, such as Javascript widgets that can be embedded in webpages to make them translatable, web APIs that allow your content management system to request translations on the fly, and more. For your users, the experience is seamless and automatic. A user simply visits your website, and if they prefer another language, WWL tools will automatically detect this and will translate the page using the best available combination of professional, volunteer and machine translations.<br><br>

<h4>For Web Users</h4>

With WWL, you can browse the web in any language. Simply install our <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/13897>Firefox Translator</a>. This free addon turns Firefox into a multilingual web browser. When you open a foreign language website, it automatically calls out to request translations from a variety of sources including professional, volunteer and machine translation services. You simply open a web page, like you do normally, except now, you can go to any website, in almost any language.<br><br>

We offer two versions of this service. Our free service, available to all Firefox users, uses volunteer translations from other addon users, as well as several popular machine translation services. We also offer a subscription service where users pay a nominal monthly fee to view professional translations for leading websites and blogs around the world. The subscription service will be available in Fall 2009, and will be offered as a free trial to everyone who is using the Firefox Translator. So download your copy today and start exploring the multilingual web.<br><br>

<h4>For Software Developers</h4>

WWL is building the world's first open source translation stack. Just as the LAMP stack has become the foundation of web services, WWL is building the tools to make translation an embedded service throughout the web. Our Firefox Translator, coded in Javascript and published under a BSD license, is one example of what the future of the multilingual web will be. In a few years, billions of people will have universal access to information through tools like this.<br><br>

In October 2009, we will be publishing TransKit, a modular and highly portable C library that enables developers to embed human/machine translation memory in any application, from web servers to client software. This library makes calling translation services simple, and is optimized for high performance applications such as web servers. This library will make WWL part of the LAMP stack, and easy to embed in open source web servers. It will also enable browser developers to embed high performance, transparent translation services within desktop and mobile browsers. This library will also be available under a BSD license to promote widespread adoption throughout the Internet/web infrastructure.<br><br>

<h4>Advantages and Benefits</h4>

<table>
<tr><td>Open Source</td><td>WWL is built entirely around open source and open standards. It can be adapted for virtually any platform, publishing system or web application. The core software is freely available under a BSD license.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Inexpensive</td><td>The software itself is free. You can build a wide variety of multilingual publishing and translation services around our tools, and can decide which services or vendors you want to work with. Traditional systems lock you into their software, and their network of translators. WWL is an open system designed to be cross platform, and to work with many vendors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Best of breed</td><td>WWL represents over ten years of research and development in human/machine translation. We are committed to eliminating the language barrier on the web. Our recent releases are an important step in this direction, with more to follow.</td></tr>

<h4>Open Source, Open Standards</h4>

The Worldwide Lexicon, in development for ten years, is built entirely around open source software and open web standards. Our translation server is written in <a href=http://www.python.org>Python</a>, a popular and powerful programming language, and runs on Google's <a href=http://appengine.google.com>App Engine</a> grid computing platform. The source code, web API and documentation are <a href=/api>available here</a> and are available under a BSD license.<br><br>

Unlike proprietary translation management systems and agencies, WWL gives you freedom from vendor lock-in and expensive recurring licenses, the ability to work with many service providers (for machine and human translations), and frees you to create custom extensions to our core platform to develop any multilingual publishing or community application you can imagine. We offer a full range of options for users, from free self-hosted DIY versions of our open source software, to turnkey solutions where we deploy and manage multilingual publishing and translation systems for you business.
