WWL For Webmasters : Building a Multilingual Website

Until recently, building a multilingual website, blog or web application was difficult, time consuming, and also expense. WWL dramatically simplifies the process of building a multilingual site, while also enabling you to combine machine and human translation in a fast and cost effective manner, and even to allow your own users to submit, score and comment on translations for your site.<p>

WWL is a "best effort" translation system, which means that it tries to provide the best available translations for a page as it is being transmitted. It usually looks for translations in the following sequence:<p>

<ol>
<li>Cached translations : if the page has already been translated, it loads the translations from local memory, so the page is generated very quickly.</li>
<li>Professional translations : first it looks for professional translations for the requested text.</li>
<li>Community translations from known users : then it looks for translations by known contributors.</li>
<li>Community translations from anonymous users : then it looks for anonymous translations (if allowed).</li>
<li>Machine translations : and then it looks for machine translations.</li>
</ol>

The system is constantly updated as users contribute translations or score translations submitted by other users (for example, to report a bad translation).<p>
