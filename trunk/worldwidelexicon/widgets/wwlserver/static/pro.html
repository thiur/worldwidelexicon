<h3>Professional Translation Network</h3>

<img src=/image/newspapers.jpg><br><br>

Read professionally translated news, commentary and analysis from leading websites, magazines and blogs worldwide. The Worldwide Lexicon is developing a professional translation network that enhances our free translation tools to provide high quality translations for the world's leading news sources and blogs.<br><br>

We will be launching the public beta of this service soon, and will offer the service to free of charge through the end of 2009. To use the service, simply install our <a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/13897>Firefox Translator</a>. When you visit websites that are covered by our translation network, you will see professionally translated text instead of computer generated translations.<br><br>

After the free trial period, we will be offering the service for a small monthly fee, and will be developing a variety of translation services that cover different languages, types of publications and industries. If you are a freelance translator and would like to earn money translating for our readers, contact us to learn more.<br><br>
