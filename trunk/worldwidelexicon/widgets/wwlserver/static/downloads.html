<h3><a href=http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/speaklike-worldwide-lexicon-translator/>WWL For WordPress</a></h3>

<img src=/image/wordpresslogosmall.png align=left>WWL for WordPress turns your WordPress site into a multilingual website. The addon is easy to install, and enables you to translate your website using a combination of machine translation, community edited translations, and optional professional translation (for as little as 6 cents per word, via <a href=http://www.speaklike.com>SpeakLike</a>). We are using the Word Press translator to translate our blog at <a href=http://blog.worldwidelexicon.org>blog.worldwidelexicon.org</a>.

<h3><a href=/lsps>WWL For Language Service Providers</a></h3>

WWL is an open marketplace for language service providers. We have built an open API that enables professional translation service bureaus and agencies worldwide to participate in our system. WWL makes your service look like an automated translation service, such as <a href=http://www.google.com/translate>Google Translate</a> or <a href=http://babelfish.yahoo.com>Babelfish</a>, so integrating your professional translation services into a WWL enabled website or application is as easy as using a machine translation service (except with much better quality).  Integrating your business into the WWL network is easy and can be completed in just a few hours.

<h3><a href=/proxy>Translation Proxy Server</a></h3>

The WWL Translation Proxy Server is an open source tool that makes any website translatable. You simply point a domain name at the proxy server, for example fr.yoursite.com for French. It loads content from www.yoursite.com and inserts the best available translations.  We are using the Translation Proxy Server to translate this website. 

<h3><a href=/transkit>TransKit SDKs</a></h3>

TransKit enables you to embed best effort translation in almost any application. We are publishing a set of high performance,
easy to use libraries that enable you to embed translation in your application, without worrying about the details of how the
translations are done. TransKit is currently available for PHP and Python. Support for C/C++, Java and Ruby is coming soon.
