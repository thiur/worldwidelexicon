We have joined Peace DOT (<a href=http://peace.stanford.edu>peace.stanford.edu</a>) and are offering our translation and multilingual communication tools to leaders in government. You can use these tools to publish a multilingual website, to browse foreign language websites, and to communicate with people across language barriers.<br><br>

<h3>Firefox Translator</h3>

Our Firefox Translator makes browsing the web in other languages effortless and automatic. Simply open a page, and if it is in a language you do not speak, it will translate the page using the best available combination of human and machine translations. You can also create and edit translations to share with other users. Simply highlight a translation and a popup editor will appear where you can edit the translation. <br><br>

<h3>Multilingual Publishing</h3>

You can use WWL to build a multilingual website using any combination of professional, volunteer and machine translations to optimize for cost, quality and speed. WWL can be integrated into almost any web publishing system. Contact us today to learn more, email brian@worldwidelexicon.org <br><br>
