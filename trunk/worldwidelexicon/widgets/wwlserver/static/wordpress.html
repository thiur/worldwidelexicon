<h2>WWL For WordPress</h2>

We are proud to announce the availability of a revolutionary new tool for web publishers, WWL for Word Press. This simple yet powerful tool enables you to publish your Word Press website in many languages, and to use a combination of machine translation, community translation, and professional translation. Machine translations are provided by several services, including <a href=http://www.google.com/translate>Google Translate</a>, <a href=http://www.apertium.org>Apertium</a>, <a href=http://www.statmt.org>Moses</a> and <a href=http://www.worldlingo.com>Worldlingo</a>. You can also allow your own readers to help translate your website to the languages they speak (you can control who is allowed to translate). With <a href=http://www.speaklike.com>SpeakLike</a>, you can have your website translated for as little as 6 cents per word. The translations are created automatically. Machine translations are available instantly. Professional translations are available quickly, usually within a few hours. All you need to do is publish, and the WWL translator will take care of everything else.<p>

<h3>Installing the Tool</h3>

NOTE: you need to have your own Word Press server to install this tool. This is not available for wordpress.com sites yet. There are many businesses that offer inexpensive Word Press hosting.<p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href=wordpress.org/extend/plugins/speaklike-worldwide-lexicon-translator/>wordpress.org</a> to download the newest version of the tool.</li>
<li>Go to the Tools menu in Word Press, then go to Plugins</li>
<li>Select Add New plug in, and then go to Upload to upload the zip file to your Word Press server, then activate the plugin</li>
<li>Go to Appearance, and then Widgets, and move the Worldwide Lexicon widget into your sidebar</li>
</ol>

<h3>Configuring The Tool</h3>

Once you have activated the Word Press plugin, go to Settings, and then Worldwide Lexicon. You will see a list of languages, with options for managing each language. For each language, you can enable or disable machine translation, enable community translation (and decide which types of users can translate), and enable or disable professional translation (you need a SpeakLike account to access professional translations).<p>

<h3>Community Translations</h3>

If community translations are activated, and a user is allowed to translate, he will see an option to edit the translation. This link leads to an editing tool where he can edit the machine translation. As a site owner, you can encourage ongoing participation by promoting and explaining this feature to your readers. You probably have many bilingual readers without knowing it. If you invite them to translate your site, many of them will help you.<p>

<h3>Professional Translations</h3>

If professional translations are activated, the system will display a temporary machine translation while it waits for SpeakLike to send a professional translation back. Once the professional translation is completed it will replace the machine translation. The time required for the translation depends on the type of plan you subscribe to, the language requested, and time of day. Most translations are completed within a day, and within a few hours for premium subscribers.<p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<ol>
<li>We recommend using machine translation for sites where quality is not extremely important. With machine translation, your new posts will be translated immediately when they are published. The translations will be visible to visitors, and will be replaced by community or professional translations when they are submitted.</li>
<li>Invite your readers to participate in community translation if you have enabled this. Be sure to install the Meta sidebar widget so users will see links to register and login to your site. If you allow anonymous translations, users do not need to be logged in. You can control who can translate by limiting translation rights to certain classes of users, for example. Remind users to login if you do not allow anonymous translations.</li>
<li>If you want professional translations for certain languages, Spanish for example, register for and fund a translation account at SpeakLike, and then provide your SpeakLike credentials in the Settings >> Worldwide Lexicon control panel.</li>
</ol>

It’s that easy to get started and start publishing in any language!<p>
