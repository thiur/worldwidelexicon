<h2>Worldwide Lexicon API : An Overview</h2>

This is a short introduction to the Worldwide Lexicon web API. You can use this API to build a wide variety of translation services, and to integrate best effort translation into your application or website. You can either build your own interface to the API, or you can use <a href=/s/transkit.html>TransKit</a> libraries (now available for Python, C and PHP) to interact with WWL services.<br><br>

The API allows you to perform the following tasks, via a simple and easy to understand interface:<br><br>

<ul><li>Find and submit translations from a translation memory, request any combination of machine, community or professional translations on a per query basis</li>
<li>Fetch and submit comments about translations.</li>
<li>Fetch and submit scores for translations.</li>
<li>Register and find real-time translators on IM and translation networks.</li>
<li>Create and manage WWL user identities and profiles, authenticate WWL users.</li>
<li>Detect the source language for a page or text, request list of machine translation services for a language pair.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>The Most Important API Calls</h3>

The most important API calls needed to build translation services are:<br><br>

<ul><li>/t : request the best available translation, using any combination of professional, volunteer or machine translation</li>
<li>/submit : submit a translation</li>
<li>/q : request a list of possible translations, similar to /t except the requester decides which translation to use</li>
<li>/scores/vote : score a translation</li>
<li>/presence/find, presence/get : find and set presence/availability status for real-time translators (if you're building a network of real-time translators, e.g. for IM sessions)</li>
<li>/users/* : family of API calls to create and manage WWL user accounts</li>
<li>/comments/* : submit and fetch comments about translations</li>
</ul>
