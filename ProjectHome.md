The [Worldwide Lexicon](http://www.worldwidelexicon.org) is a collaborative translation memory that combines inputs from professional, community and machine translations. It is an open source system that runs on [Google App Engine](http://appengine.google.com) and is accessed via a simple web API, or via our easy to use TransKit libraries for popular programming languages.

We currently offer easy to use best effort translation plugins for Word Press, Firefox and Drupal (visit our website for more information and documentation). We also offer TransKit, a family of libraries for popular programming languages including PHP, Python, C/C++ and Java, as well as a translation proxy server that can front end any website or web service.

This website serves primarily as a code repository (you can browse the current source code via our SVN here). For documentation, customer support and other inquiries, go to [www.worldwidelexicon.org](http://www.worldwidelexicon.org) or email bsmcconnell at gmail
