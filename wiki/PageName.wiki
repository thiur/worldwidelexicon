#summary Worldwide Lexicon Translation Memory and Translation Tools

= Introduction =

The Worldwide Lexicon is an open translation memory that can be integrated into a wide range of websites and web applications. It can be used to make any site translatable, from web magazines, to interactive web applications. WWL is modeled after user generated sites like Wikipedia, and makes it easy for people to contribute, edit and curate translations into the languages they speak. We also support popular machine translation services, but primarily focus on human translators, and creating active translation communities around popular websites.
